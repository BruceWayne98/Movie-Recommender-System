# Movie-Recommender-System
Project done using Python. This project extracts and scraps top 250 movies data from imdb and omdb database, storing it as a csv file. If a user gives a input name of a movie, the system compares the similarity of the movie with other movies using CountVectorizer and CosineSimilarity, and recommends top 'k' movies with high similarity.
